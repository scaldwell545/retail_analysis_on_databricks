## Analysis Performed

Create a list of all countries to which orders have been shipped. <br>


- How many orders have been placed in total? <br>


- How many orders have been shipped to each country? <br>
<img class="image-align-left" src="https://github.com/scaldwell545/retail_analysis_on_databricks/blob/main/Resources/countByCountry.png" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/scaldwell545/retail_analysis_on_databricks/blob/main/Resources/countByCountry.png" width="700" height="600" />





For each product, list its product ID, product name, and the company name. <br>


- Which 5 countries have the heaviest shipments, on average? <br>


- Which 10 companies have placed the most orders? List the contact name of each company. <br>




Sort the customers by total amount spent on orders in descending order. <br>

Sort customers with a total spending greater than 20,000 in descending order. <br>


Sort the employees by the number of orders they sold in descending order. <br>

How many employees account for about half of the orders?  <br>


List customers who have never placed an order. <br>


List the products with the highest level of discount in descending order. <br>
